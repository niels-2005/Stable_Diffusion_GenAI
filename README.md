# Stable_Diffusion_GenAI

Welcome to the **Stable_Diffusion_GenAI** repository! This project leverages TensorFlow and Keras CV to generate detailed images from textual descriptions using the Stable Diffusion model. Our goal is to transform creative textual prompts into visually compelling images.

## Project Overview

**Stable_Diffusion_GenAI** employs the pretrained Stable Diffusion model from Keras CV for generating images that correspond to a variety of text prompts.

## Features

- **Image Generation**: Utilizes a machine learning model to convert text prompts into images.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for customization of image dimensions and the number of generated images.
- **Visualization**: Includes functionality to display generated images immediately.

## Examples

The model can handle a diverse range of prompts, generating unique artistic interpretations for each. Example prompts include futuristic cityscapes and fantastical creatures, showcasing the model's versatility in generating both realistic and imaginative artwork.
